NOTE : Based on talks with the professor, we have implemented the program as directed but with a little change. We donâ€™t take the path of the input file, instead we read the data from the link that the professor has provided. We did this to learn how to cater dynamic changes in the data. Thus we have used only 2 parameters instead of 3 parameters.
